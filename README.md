## A template for .NET projects

1. Put the Intro, Dependency installation, Build instructions in this doc
    1. ... and/or link to further docs stored in `/docs` folder.
1. Put your product/project source in `/src`
1. Put your tests in `test`
1. Put build, CI/CD type files in `eng` where possible 
  1. Some prefer to live in the root, e.g. `stylecop.json`
  1. Some are more sensible in the root, e.g. `build.cmd`


What follows are suggested topics, not mandatory, though you should give enough detail to get working locally and gotchas around CI/CD.
